##My Thoughts:
- Resources can be used to prevent overloading
- In index method of BookingController, some part of the code can be moved to BookingRepository
- Resources should be used when returning JSON responses
- Traits can be used
- controllers action should be single
- some variables are declared without using it
- some of the if else statements can be minimized
